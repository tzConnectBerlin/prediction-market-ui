              We have built this demo of the prediction market with a set of markets created for the
              current Formula 1 races. The markets will run on the Granada testnet until the

              We invite everyone to play with these markets. You play by betting on the different
              drivers to win (or lose), by adding liquidity to markets to profit from others’ bets,
              and by exploiting swings in the markets.

              The overarching goal is to maximise the amount of PMM you have, by any of the above
              methods. At the end of the series the player who has increased their PMM by the
              largest amount, only using the three methods above (bet, add liquidity, create market)
              will be declared the winner and will receive an actual prize of 500 tez.

                The purpose of this stage is to raise liquidity. Users may participate in the
                pre-market by providing a bet, specifying a predicted probability of the outcome,
                and placing tokens. When the pre-market is cleared, these positions will be
                converted into a combination of a holding of the preferred outcome token, and a
                stake in the liquidity pool (i.e. liquidity tokens), based on the clearing
                mathematics.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="p" marginTop="1rem">
                Markets are not cleared automatically at the clearing date - any participant may
                call the clearing function at will on a single market, and paying the transaction
                fee, clear it. Until explicitly cleared, markets continue to operate in the
                pre-trading phase.

                Predictions with a higher or lower certainty will be converted into respectively
                more outcome tokens or more liquidity tokens after clearing. As liquidity providers,
                pre-market participants are eligible to receive a share of the swap fee, as well as
                a liquidity provider reward from the 5% redemption fee.

                In this stage users can buy Yes and No tokens, sell their tokens, burn yes/no pairs
                of outcome tokens for currency (the nominal value of 1 minus fee), and contribute
                liquidity to the market (for which they will receive a share of profits).

                The spot prices depend on the ratio of Yes to No tokens in the market’s liquidity

              <Typography component="p" marginTop="1rem">
                Markets are resolved by an adjudicator contract, using data from an oracle which
                injects Formula 1 scores from the public API at ergast.com. Once a market is
                resolved according to the resolution criteria in the market description, all trading
                is suspended, and outcome tokens expire at 0% or 100% of their nominal value (minus
                redemption fee) respectively.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="p" marginTop="1rem">
                After resolution, users with a stake in the market - including liquidity tokens,

                the currency token.
